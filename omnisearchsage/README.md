<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Abstract
In this paper, we present OmniSearchSage, a versatile and scalable system for understanding search queries, pins, and products for Pinterest search.
We jointly learn a unified query embedding coupled with pin and product embeddings, leading to > 8% relevance, > 7% engagement, 
and > 5% ads CTR gain in Pinterest‚Äôs production search system. The main contributors to these gains are improved content understanding, 
better multi-task learning, and real-time serving. We enrich our entity representations using diverse text derived from image captions 
from a generative LLM, historical engagement, and user-curated boards. Our multitask learning setup
produces a single search query embedding in the same space as pin and product embeddings and compatible with pre-existing pin and
product embeddings. We show the value of each feature through ablation studies, and show the effectiveness of a unified model
compared to standalone counterparts. Finally, we share how these embeddings have been deployed across the Pinterest search stack,
from retrieval to ranking, scaling to serve 300ùëò requests per second at low latency.
